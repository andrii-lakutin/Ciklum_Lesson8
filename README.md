HOW TO RUN: 

clone -> npm i -> npm run devserver -> localhost:3030/#/pokemons -> clear localStorage -> refresh page -> localhost:3030/#

ISSUES: 
1)Route work stange: all work fine, redirects work, but without refresh page and change route it`s load nothing.
2)IMAGES got 403. (if you wanna see how it looks with images - open console in browser , visit links from 403 errors, images will be load from cache)


ROUTES:

localhost:3030/#/ OR localhost:3030/#/pokemons - main page

localhost:3030/#/favorites - favorites pokemons
